;parameters related to the agent
[agent]
; for now the following parameter can be : TimeBased, DaemonBased
detection_method=TimeBased
; this parameter represent the number of instructions per seconds which cost by the agent (it's heavy with the jvm)
mips_agent_utilization=1000
; this parameter represents the bandwidth cost caused by the agent (this should take in account network exchanges with the server 0), in MoB  ²&é"P
bw_agent_utilization=20


[TimeBased]
repeating_time=500

; the mips cost of the daemon on the hosts
[DaemonBased]
; this parameter represent the number of instructions per seconds which cost by the daemon
mips_daemon_utilization=100
; out of the following bounds, hosts ask to get the agent (should be between 0 and 1)
